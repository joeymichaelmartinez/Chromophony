This is a good start!

You can ALWAYS specify more.  Try to think in terms of "if someone ELSE
were to code this project, what would they need to know about the way it
operates?  What information could I provide them so they can be successful
in the implementation?

For example, in 5.3.3, what are the states from which the "current" state
is selected?  In 5.3.4, what are the assets that might be manipulated?

In 5.3.5, the statement should be:

5.3.5  The management software shall provide operations including but
       not limited to the following:
       * controlling the state of the virtual experience
       * triggering asset utilization
       * triggering audio playback
       * triggering visual response to the audio

You will also need [somwhere] to specify what the assets are, and what
the states are.  You can always use bullet lists, but THOSE don't get
numbers, because they are further information that EXPAND on the
requirement -- they are not requirements themselves.

I hope that makes sense.

Make a few changes there, add a couple more requirements and you'll be
good to go.


Otherwise, nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 14.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              27.18 out of 28.18 points = 96.45% which is an A

Keep it up!
